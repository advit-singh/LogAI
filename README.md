# LogAI: Your Intelligent Journaling Companion  

Welcome to **LogAI**, a personal project exploring the possibilities of AI-powered journaling. Designed to provide an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing journaling experience, LogAI aims to blend modern design principles with advanced AI capabilities. While not all features are fully implemented—given the complexity and scope—this project serves as a conceptual foundation for what a feature-rich journaling app could achieve.

## **Technical Framework**  

This project is built using the following technologies:  
- **Frontend**:  
  - React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design.  
  - ShadCN-UI components for polished and reusable interface elements.  
- **Backend**:  
  - Supabase for secure storage and user authentication.  
  - AI transcription and NLP powered by OpenAI’s Whisper (conceptual).  
- **Audio Handling**:  
  - Audio recording and playback designed using Web Audio API.

## **Limitations**  

As a personal project, LogAI is not fully functional. Many features—such as advanced AI insights, voice transcription, and comprehensive analytics—are included as theoretical components to illustrate the app’s potential. Building a complete, production-ready version would require extensive time, resources, and infrastructure beyond the scope of this project.

## **Vision**  

LogAI represents an exploration of the intersection between AI and personal journaling. While not fully realized, it highlights the possibilities of creating an intelligent journaling experience that empowers users to reflect on their thoughts and habits.  

Thank you for exploring LogAI!
