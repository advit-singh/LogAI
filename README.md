# AI Journaling App

A minimalist AI-powered journaling app built with Next.js, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS.  This app allows users to create journal entries using text or voice input, with AI-powered transcription and analysis.

## Features

* **Text and Voice Journaling:** Create entries using a rich text editor or by recording audio.
* **AI-Powered Transcription:**  Transcribe voice recordings into text using a simulated AI service (in a real application, this would use a service like OpenAI's Whisper API or AssemblyAI).
* **AI-Powered Insights:**  Gain insights from your journal entries, including mood detection and keyword extraction (simulated AI service used).
* **Responsive Design:**  The app is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices.
* **Clean and Minimalist UI:**  Uses ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS for a modern and visually appealing interface.
* **Dark Mode Support:**  Easily switch between light and dark modes.
* **Secure Storage:**  Journal entries are stored securely (simulated Supabase integration).
* **Customizable Settings:**  Adjust various settings to personalize your journaling experience.

**Note:** This project uses a simulated backend and AI services for demonstration purposes.  A production-ready application would require integration with a real AI transcription service and a database.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, react-h5-audio-player, input-otp, react-resizable-panels, @radix-ui/react-* components
* **Backend (Simulated):** Supabase (requires configuration)
* **AI Services (Simulated):**  AI transcription and analysis are simulated.  For a real application, consider OpenAI's Whisper API, AssemblyAI, or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
